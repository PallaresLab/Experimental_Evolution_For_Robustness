Results of first generation of high-sugar exposure. The main script is under /code folder.

The data folder includes objects for:

- Flight analysis
- Wing analysis
- Integrative/correlative analysis

I am to answer 2 big questions in this analysis :
1. How does robustness compare on different levels? 'Master' script targets this question.
    - 1.A) Do we have robust vs non-robust populations across all layers or does each trait have its own robust vs. non-robust population that doesn't overlap with the other traits? 
          - My preliminary answer to this question is that robustness is a unique property of all the different traits.
    - 1.B) Does the change in the diet contribute to changes in the robustness of certain phenotypes
2. Does form correlate with function?
   - I address this question with various algorithms (Random Forests, Support Vec machine, and LASSO regressions) that learn how phenotypes scores (wing coords, symmetry, sizes)
    can predict function of a fly (flight)
   - Predictions.R script targets this question.

Once there is gentic data, there will be a script that maps each phenotypic score to a particular (group of ) SNPs.
